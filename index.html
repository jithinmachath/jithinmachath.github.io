    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <article class="card" id="about">
        <h2>👤 About Me</h2>
       <p>
I am a Mechanical Design Engineer with over 4 years of experience building real-world, field-deployed systems in robotics and industrial environments. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to deployment—translating complex engineering challenges into practical, reliable, and manufacturable solutions.
</p>

<p>
My work has involved system-level mechanical design, hydraulic integration, structural optimisation, and validation under actual operating conditions—ensuring safety, durability, and performance where it truly matters. I have worked across multiple robotic and industrial systems, with a strong focus on electro-mechanical integration, material selection, and design for manufacturability.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly drawn to solving problems with high constraints—tight spaces, harsh environments, and safety-critical requirements. Beyond design, I have coordinated cross-functional teams and supported engineering activities across design, fabrication, and testing phases, helping drive projects from development to deployment.
</p>

<p>
I value clarity in design, simplicity in solutions, and systems that perform reliably in the field—not just on paper. My core tools include SolidWorks, AutoCAD, and ANSYS (FEA), which I use to support design, analysis, and validation in demanding applications.

    <div class="exp-block">

        <h3>Building Systems from Concept to Field Deployment</h3>
        <p class="exp-meta">Robotics & Industrial Systems | 2021 – Present</p>

        <p>
        My work centers around developing robotic and industrial systems that are designed not just to function, but to perform reliably in real-world conditions. I have been involved across the entire product lifecycle—from early concept development through detailed design, prototyping, and field validation.
        </p>

        <p>
        A key part of my role has been system-level mechanical design, including hydraulic integration and structural optimisation, with a strong emphasis on manufacturability and deployment constraints. Many of the systems I’ve worked on operate in demanding environments, where safety, durability, and performance are critical.
        </p>

        <p>
        Beyond design, I work closely with cross-functional teams across fabrication, assembly, and testing, helping translate engineering concepts into working systems. This has given me strong exposure to execution, field deployment, and real-time problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ve also contributed to improving how engineering is done within the organization—supporting the development of SOPs and structured workflows to bring consistency and clarity to the product development process.
